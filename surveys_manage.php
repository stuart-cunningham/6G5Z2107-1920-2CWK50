// Things to notice:
// This is the page where each user can MANAGE their surveys
// As a suggestion, you may wish to consider using this page to LIST the surveys they have created
// Listing the available surveys for each user will probably involve accessing the contents of another TABLE in your database
// Give users options such as to CREATE a new survey, EDIT a survey, ANALYSE a survey, or DELETE a survey, might be a nice idea
// You will probably want to make some additional PHP scripts that let your users CREATE and EDIT surveys and the questions they contain
// REMEMBER: Your admin will want a slightly different view of this page so they can MANAGE all of the users' surveys

// execute the header script:
require_once "header.php";

// checks the session variable named 'loggedInSkeleton'
// take note that of the '!' (NOT operator) that precedes the 'isset' function
if (!isset($_SESSION['loggedInSkeleton']))
{
	// user isn't logged in, display a message saying they must be:
	echo "You must be logged in to view this page.<br>";
}

// the user must be signed-in, show them suitable page content
else
{
	echo "Use this space to allow your users to create and manage their surveys<br>";
    echo "At present, there are no surveys to display<br>";
    
    // a little extra text that only the admin will see:
	if ($_SESSION['username'] == "admin")
	{
		echo "[admin sees more!]<br>";
	}
    
}

// finish off the HTML for this page:
require_once "footer.php";
